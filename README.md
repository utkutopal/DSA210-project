# My YouTube Usage Patterns During Exam Periods
Project Overview
This project explores changes in my YouTube usage during exam periods, focusing on:

Watch Time: Does my YouTube usage increase or decrease during exams?
Content Categories: How do the types of videos I watch (e.g., educational, entertainment, gaming) change during exams?
By analyzing my YouTube history, the goal is to identify patterns and correlations between exam-related stress, study habits, and YouTube usage. The analysis will cover specific exam periods, including 1-month windows around midterms and assignment deadlines, to capture shifts in behavior and preferences.
