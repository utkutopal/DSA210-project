# My YouTube Usage Patterns During Exam Periods
Project Overview

This project explores changes in my YouTube usage during exam periods, focusing on:

Watch Time: Does my YouTube usage increase or decrease during exams?

Content Categories: How do the types of videos I watch (e.g., educational, entertainment) change during exams?
By analyzing my YouTube history, the goal is to identify patterns and correlations between exam-related stress, study habits, and YouTube usage. The analysis will cover specific exam periods, including 1.5-month windows around midterms and finals, to capture shifts in behavior and preferences.

# Motivation
As a student, Iâ€™ve observed that my YouTube habits seem to shift during exam periods. This project seeks to understand whether:

My total watch time increases or decreases during exams.
The content I watch shifts towards specific categories like study-related videos, entertainment, or gaming.
The ultimate goal is to uncover insights into how academic pressures shape digital consumption behaviors and whether YouTube acts as a tool for productivity, stress relief, or procrastination.

# Data Source
Personal YouTube Data

The dataset will be derived from my YouTube watch history archive, which includes:

Watch History: Timestamps, video titles, and durations.

Categorization of Videos
To analyze video preferences, each video will be categorized as:

Educational/Study-Related: Tutorials, lectures, or study aids.

Entertainment: Movies, shows, or general relaxation content.
Gameplay, walkthroughs, or gaming commentary.

Manual tagging and metadata analysis will be used for this categorization.

# Research Questions
1- Does my YouTube watch time increase or decrease during exam periods?

2- Do the types of videos I watch (e.g., educational, entertainment) change during exams?

# Progress Monitoring
Regular updates will be shared in this repository, which will include:

Data Preprocessing Scripts: Scripts used to clean and organize YouTube history data for analysis.

Visualizations and Results: Graphs, charts, and key insights that highlight watch time trends and content shifts during exam periods.
By documenting each stage of the project, the repository will ensure transparency and reproducibility of the analysis.
